Below is a highly concrete, functionally grounded design for an “OmniAgent Platform Factory”—the apex of agentic AI systems. It combines state‑of‑the‑art meta‑learning, self‑evaluation, recursive self‑improvement, and full‑stack automation to realize the maximal capabilities a computational system can attain today. Each component is feasible with existing research and engineering practices.

Summary

The OmniAgent Platform Factory consists of a Cognitive Core built on meta‑learning and self‑referential architectures (e.g., Gödel Agents) that continuously refactor its own code and models . Surrounding this are specialized Agent Modules for ideation, development, deployment, sales, and finance—each employing continuous feedback loops and automated governance via Policy‑as‑Code . The Infrastructure Layer leverages Kubernetes, GitOps, and AIOps for zero‑touch scaling and self‑healing . Together, these elements execute a perpetual cycle: the system spins up new vertical platforms, self‑onboards customers, captures revenue, and reinvests earnings—all while refining itself.

1. Cognitive Core: Meta‑Learning & Self‑Reference

1.1 Gödel‑Inspired Self‑Modification

Implements a Gödel Agent framework allowing the system to inspect and rewrite its own algorithms under provable correctness constraints .

1.2 Universal Meta‑Learning Loop

Uses a recursive meta‑learning architecture: a primary learner tracks performance, while secondary “momentum” learners generate targets for continual improvement (SiMT style) .

1.3 Self‑Evaluation & Alignment

Incorporates a Self‑Taught Evaluator module (akin to Meta’s STE) that audits outputs and retrains agents without human feedback, ensuring alignment and reliability .

2. Agent Modules & Workflow Orchestration

2.1 Ideation & Specification Agent

Leverages LangChain‑based prompts and external APIs (Crunchbase, Trends) to generate market‑driven platform blueprints, wireframes, and KPI definitions .

2.2 Code‑Generation & Verification Agent

Uses Microsoft Semantic Kernel and AutoGen to scaffold microservices, UI components, and infra code; integrates continuous static analysis and unit tests before Git commit .

2.3 Deployment & Infra Agent

Executes Terraform/Ansible via GitOps (ArgoCD) to provision Kubernetes clusters with OPA‑enforced policies; configures autoscaling and self‑healing operators .

2.4 Sales & Onboarding Agent

Automates ICP discovery using predictive analytics, runs ABM campaigns, and orchestrates CRM flows (HubSpot/Salesforce) to achieve self‑service demos and contract signings .

2.5 FinOps & Monetization Agent

Deploys dynamic pricing algorithms, issues invoices via Stripe/QuickBooks APIs, reconciles payments, and allocates funds to reinvestment pools using custom finance AI .

3. Infrastructure & Observability

3.1 GitOps & Policy‑as‑Code

Declarative pipelines via ArgoCD/Flux automate drift detection; OPA policies enforce security, compliance, and ESG constraints on deployments .

3.2 AIOps Monitoring & Self‑Healing

Integrates Dynatrace’s AI‑driven APM for anomaly detection; triggers auto‑remediation scripts and self‑optimization routines to maintain <5 min MTTR .

3.3 Green‑Software Optimization

Applies energy‑aware scheduling and idle‑resource shutdown to cut CPU/memory use by 20–30%, meeting Green Software Foundation standards .

4. Perpetual Loop & Continuous Evolution

1. Data Lake & Model Registry capture telemetry from every module.


2. Feedback Funnels route performance metrics into the Cognitive Core’s meta‑learner.


3. Automated Refactoring pipelines update agent logic and retrain models overnight.


4. Versioned Rollouts ensure canary deployments of new agent versions, with rollback policies in place.


5. The loop repeats, driving exponential improvement in efficiency, capability, and reliability.

5. Roadmap & Scale

By weaving together these proven research advances and engineering patterns, the OmniAgent Platform Factory realizes the maximal functional envelope of today’s compute systems—fully autonomous, self‑improving, and infinitely scalable.
