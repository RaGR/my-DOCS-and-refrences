**1. Remove the Existing Installation**

* **Delete the `build` and `dist` directories:** These directories often contain temporary files and distribution artifacts from previous builds.

* **Remove the installed package from your environment:**
    * If you installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`), the package should be linked to the current directory. You can usually uninstall it using:
      ```bash
      pip uninstall -y <your_package_name> 
      ```
      Replace `<your_package_name>` with the actual name of your package.

* **Clear pip's cache:** This removes any cached downloads or installation records that might interfere with a clean reinstallation:
    ```bash
    pip cache purge 
    ```

**2. Clean the Virtual Environment (if applicable)**

If you're working within a virtual environment, it's generally best to start fresh:

   ```bash
   deactivate  # Exit the current virtual environment
   rm -rf <path/to/your/venv>  # Delete the entire virtual environment directory 
   ```
   Then, recreate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv <path/to/your/new/venv>
   source <path/to/your/new/venv>/bin/activate 
   ```

**3. Update `setup.cfg`**

* **Carefully review your `setup.cfg` file:** 
    * **Check for incorrect dependencies:** Ensure that all dependencies are correctly specified, including versions.
    * **Remove any problematic packages:** If certain packages consistently cause issues, remove them from the `install_requires` section.
    * **Consider using a `requirements.txt` file:** For better maintainability, you can often move your dependencies from `setup.cfg` to a separate `requirements.txt` file. This allows for easier updates and version pinning.

**4. Reinstall with `pip`**

* **Update `pip` itself:**
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip 
    ```

* **Install your package in editable mode:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e . 
    ```

**5. Test Thoroughly**

* **Run your tests:** Execute your test suite to ensure that everything is working as expected. This helps identify any lingering issues or regressions.
* **Test manually:** Perform a thorough manual testing of your package's functionality to verify that all features are working correctly.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

* **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Use tools like `pipdeptree` to visualize your package's dependency graph and identify potential conflicts.
* **Isolate issues:** Try installing packages individually to pinpoint the source of the problems.
* **Consult the documentation:** Refer to the documentation of any problematic packages for potential solutions or workarounds.
* **Search for known issues:** Check online forums, issue trackers, and Stack Overflow for known issues related to the packages you're using.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively reset your installation and address any issues you're encountering. Remember to test thoroughly after each step to ensure a smooth and successful development process.
