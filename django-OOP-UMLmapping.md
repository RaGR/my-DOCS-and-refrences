working on a large scale Object Orianted project can be chalenging at first glass. but as jappanies say -> crysis and opportunity are linked and kinda the same thing

maybe the very very HUGE code base you are intracting with can be chalenging. but you can use this beasts artributes maybe againt itself

for example in a large SOLID OOP project that is larg scale and ever expanding - the structure of folders and where your desired code can be mind buggling

but if you use the right tools in the right place you can become a good friend with your code base and enjoy its comppany

i suggest for you to use pycharm tools to get familiarized with the code base. and plus that use the power of greate python libraries that analize code for you

you pfcurce need a preficient knoledge in the art of COMPUTER ENG to grasp the full idea of MAPs provided to you
