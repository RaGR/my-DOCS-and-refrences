**Example:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
```

---

### **7. Programming and Scripting**
- **Python/Bash**: They write scripts to automate tasks or process data.
- **System Programming**: They understand how to interact with the Linux kernel and system libraries.
- **Version Control**: They use Git extensively for managing code and configurations.

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.log; do
    grep "ERROR" "$file" > "${file%.log}_errors.txt"
done
```

---

### **8. Problem-Solving Mindset**
- **RTFM**: They read documentation thoroughly before asking for help.
- **Debugging Skills**: They use tools like `strace`, `gdb`, and `journalctl` to debug issues.
- **Resourcefulness**: They know where to look for solutions (e.g., Stack Overflow, man pages, forums).

**Example:**
```bash
strace -p $(pgrep myapp)
```

---

### **9. Security Awareness**
- **Least Privilege**: They follow the principle of least privilege for user permissions.
- **Encryption**: They use tools like LUKS for disk encryption and GPG for file encryption.
- **Auditing**: They regularly audit their systems for vulnerabilities.

**Example:**
```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
